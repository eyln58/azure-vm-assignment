# 🚀 My First Azure Infrastructure Setup: Building a Basic Cloud Environment ☁️💻  

I recently completed a hands-on project setting up a foundational **Azure infrastructure** using a **free Azure account**. Here's what I did and the valuable skills I gained along the way:  

## 📂 Creating a Resource Group  
I started by creating a **Resource Group** to organize all my Azure resources under a **single management unit**. This taught me about **Azure’s resource organization model** and how proper grouping simplifies **management, deployment, and billing**.  

## 🌐 Setting Up a Virtual Network  
Next, I established a **Virtual Network** with a **default subnet**. This helped me understand **Azure networking**, **subnet segmentation**, and how **secure communication** is established between Azure resources.  

## 🖥 Deploying a Windows Virtual Machine  
I deployed a **free-tier eligible Windows Server VM** and:  
- ⚡ Configured a **Public IP address** for remote access  
- 🔗 Placed the VM within my **Virtual Network**  
- 🔐 Set up **security credentials** and basic **network security**  

This process taught me about **VM sizing options**, **OS image selection**, and the **importance of proper security configurations** when exposing resources to the internet.  

## 💾 Attaching a Data Disk  
I added an **Azure Disk** to my **Virtual Machine**, learning about **Azure's storage options**, **disk types**, and **cloud-based volume management**.  

## 🔌 Connecting to the VM  
Using **Remote Desktop (RDP)**, I successfully connected to my **VM** using the assigned **public IP**. This demonstrated how cloud resources can be **managed remotely**, similar to on-premises servers, giving me hands-on experience with **secure remote administration**.  

## 🗑 Cleaning Up Resources  
Finally, I **deleted the Resource Group** to avoid unnecessary charges. I learned about **Azure’s cost management** and the **importance of resource cleanup** to avoid unexpected costs.  

## 🚀 Key Learnings  
🔹 **Resource Management**: Creating and organizing resources in Azure  
🔹 **Networking**: Configuring virtual networks & subnets  
🔹 **Compute Services**: Deploying and managing VMs  
🔹 **Storage**: Adding and managing data disks  
🔹 **Security**: Setting up credentials and securing remote access  
🔹 **Cost Management**: Deleting unused resources to **avoid unnecessary charges**
